# Python-DDos-
Full high bandwidth DDOS

WARNING
the following DDOS is extreamly volatile and may cause your PC to crash if left unchecked.
I am not responsible for any crashed and subsequent loss of data from using this code.

Code requires an active webserver to connect to. 
It expects the webserver to post the following line (ipaddress)</br>(client) e.g. 192.168.1.1</br>1
It will not understand anything more and will error.

This is using UDP sockets which will spike all your upload speed without any caps. This will kick you off any application/games which you must uplaod to, including skype,teamspeak etc...

use Updater.py to update the webserver
use ddos.py to launch an attatch.

The ddos is not fully complete so some functions like changin targest is not fully working, to cange targets simply restart the application.

At the fist sign of you PC becoming unresponsive it is advides you colse the application!

Should work on all windows, mac and linux operating systems using python 2.7
No additional moduals are reuired for this code.

Please use responsibly.
